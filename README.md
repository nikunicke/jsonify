# Text to JSON

This program allows you to dynamically generate JSON arrays from structured text files.
The text files need to be of similar structure as the "test" file in this repo.
### KEY: VALUE

As of now, program is not very nicely structured or commented.
Run with 'go run main.go' or compile with 'go build'
